Blipstick is a simple addon to change the minimap blip textures. I wrote it because I didn't like the big huge '!' and '?' Blizzard used, so I adjusted the sizes a bit. Since then I've added in blips from other addons and created a config panel so the user can select the set of blips they like.

I welcome any new blip textures, just open up a bug on "GCode":http://code.google.com/p/tekkub-wow/issues/list?can=1&q=addon:Blipstick&sort=status+milestone&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Addon%20Milestone%20Summary and attach the texture.
